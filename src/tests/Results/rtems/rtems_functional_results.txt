OSAL 4.2 functional tests run on RTEMS 4.11

Test Setup:

Using RTEMS 4.11 (git branch)  
SPARC architecture, sis ( SPARC Instruction Simulator ) BSP.
Tools were compiled using the RTEMS Source Builder (RSB) tool on Ubuntu Linux 14.04 LTS.

RTEMS Quick start instructions: 
https://devel.rtems.org/wiki/TBR/UserManual/Quick_Start

The RTEMS Source Builder documentation is here:
https://docs.rtems.org/rsb/

The sis BSP runs using the simulator that is included with the RTEMS SPARC compiler tools. 
It can be used with GDB or with the standalone "sparc-rtems4.11-run" tool. 

Examples:

sparc-rtems4.11-gdb my-test.nxe
(gdb) target sim
(gdb) load
(gdb) run

or

sparc-rtems4.11-run my-test.nxe


Files changed:

1. OSAL RTEMS files: 
1a. osapi.c - added an ifdef for the module loader. If we dont use a module loader, need to comment out the call to OS_ModuleUnload.

1b. osfilesys.c - added the RTEMS_FILESYSTEM_READ_WRITE flag to the mount call. Otherwise the ram disk was mounted as READ ONLY and the file api tests fail.

2. src/bsp/sis-rtems files
2a. config/osconfig.h - updated to pc-rtems osconfig.h file. turned off loader and network options. 
2b. added ut-src directory, started with the pc-rtems version. Changes include:
    - Create /drive0 /drive1 mount points for file system tests. 
    - Comment out IDE disk code
    - changed volume table to have two physical RAM disks

3. Environment files:
3a. osal-config.mak - Changed BSP = sis-rtems
3b. setvars.sh - Set RTEMS BASE variable:
export RTEMS_BSP_BASE="/opt/rtems/bsps/4.11"

This is the location of the SPARC/sis bsp. When building RTEMS , this BSP path is specified in the configure command. Example:
../rtems-4.11-src/configure --target=sparc-rtems4.11 \
--enable-tests=samples \
--enable-posix \
--prefix=/opt/rtems/bsps/4.11

    
Test Results:

Summary: The example and all functional tests were run and passed except for:

1. symbol-api-test : Was not run, no dynamic loader configured
2. file-api-test: Test 02.009 failed, a different error code was returned
   ( Test was supposed to fail, but return an invalid path error ) 

The following functional tests were run using the sparc-rtems4.11-run command:

build/examples/tasking-example  - works, use control-C to exit (same with all tests) 
build/tests/bin-sem-flush-test - PASS:20, FAIL:0
build/tests/bin-sem-test - PASS:12, FAIL:0
build/tests/bin-sem-timeout-test - PASS:15, FAIL:0
build/tests/count-sem-test - PASS:16, FAIL:0
build/tests/file-api-test - PASS:117, FAIL:1
   ( Failure was 02.009 TestCreatRemove,  The test expected an ivalid path, but in 
     RTEMS, there is a root file system where files can be created "/". The error was 
     file not found, rather than invalid path ) 
build/tests/mutex-test - PASS:14, FAIL:0
build/tests/osal-core-test - PASS:407, FAIL:0
build/tests/queue-timeout-test - PASS:11, FAIL:0
build/tests/symbol-api-test - did not run, loader not configured
build/tests/timer-test - PASS:21, FAIL:0
With the file changes mentioned above the functions tests are expected to produce the 
following detailed results:

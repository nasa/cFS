/**
 * @file
 *
 * Purpose: This file contains the cFE performance IDs
 *
 * Design Notes:
 *   Each performance id is used to identify something that needs to be
 *   measured.  Performance ids are limited to the range of 0 to
 *   CFE_MISSION_ES_PERF_MAX_IDS - 1.  Any performance ids outside of this range
 *   will be ignored and will be flagged as an error.  Note that
 *   performance ids 0-31 are reserved for the cFE Core.

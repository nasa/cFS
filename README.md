# Core Flight System - BUNDLE

This repository is a bundle of submodules that make up the Core Flight System (cFS) framework.  Note the "lab" apps are intended as examples only, and enable this bundle to build, execute, receive commands, and send telemetry.  This is not a flight distribution, which is typically made up of the cFE, OSAL, PSP, and a selection of flight apps that coorespond to specific mission requirements.

This bundle has not been fully verified as an operational system, and is provided as a starting point vs an end product.  Testing of this bundle consists of building, executing, sending setup commands and verifying receipt of telemetry.  Unit testing is also run, but extensive analysis is not performed.  All verification and validation per mission requirements is the responsibility of the mission (although attempts are made in the cFS Framework to provide a testing framework to facilitate the process).

The cFS Framework is a core subset of cFS.  There are additional OSALs, PSPs, and tools as listed below available from a variety of sources.

## Known issues

Historical version description documents contain references to internal repositories and sourceforge, which is no longer in use.  Not all markdown documents have been updated for GitHub.

See related repositories for current open issues.

## Major future work

  - Certification framework with automated build verification tests of framework requirements
    - Executable on real/emulated/simulated/ or dockerized targets
    - Add PSP coverage testing framework
    - Add PSP and cFE functional testing framework for APIs
    - Scrub OSAL coverage and functional tests 
  - Open source automated build verification execution framework for emulated targets (likely docker based)
  - Provide capability for mission customization of core services
  - Deployment quality of life improvements (configuration, transition to CMake source selection vs compiler directives)
  - Update OS support (VxWorks 7, RTEMS 5)
  - Time services refactor
  - Documentation (updated tracability, APIs/ICDs, general update)
  - Symmetric multi-processing APIs
  - Electronic Data Sheet integration option and improvements to packet layouts for portability/consistancy
  - Toolchain updates

## Setup

To setup the cFS BUNDLE directly from the latest set of interoperable repositories:

    git clone https://github.com/nasa/cFS.git
    cd cFS
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

Copy in the default makefile and definitions:

    cp cfe/cmake/Makefile.sample Makefile
    cp -r cfe/cmake/sample_defs sample_defs

## Build and Run

The cFS Framework including sample applications will build and run on the pc-linux platform support package (should run on most Linux distributions), via the steps described in https://github.com/nasa/cFE/tree/master/cmake/README.md.  Quick-start is below:

To prep, compile, and run on the host (from cFS directory above) as a normal user (best effort message queue depth and task priorities):

    make SIMULATION=native prep
    make
    make install
    cd build/exe/cpu1/
    ./core-cpu1

Should see startup messages, and CFE_ES_Main entering OPERATIONAL state.  Note the code must be executed from the build/exe/cpu1 directory to find the startup script and shared objects.

Note: The steps above are for a debug, permissive mode build and includes deprecated elements.  For a release build, recommendation is `make BUILDTYPE=release OMIT_DEPRECATED=true prep`.  Unit tests can be added with `ENABLE_UNIT_TESTS=true`, run with `make test`, and coverage reported with `make lcov`.

## Send commands, receive telemetry

The cFS-GroundSystem tool can be used to send commands and receive telemetry (see https://github.com/nasa/cFS-GroundSystem/tree/master/Guide-GroundSystem.txt, the Guide-GroundSystem.txt).  Note it depends on PyQt5 and PyZMQ:

1. Install PyQt5 and PyZMQ on your system
2. Compile cmdUtil and start the ground system executable

       cd tools/cFS-GroundSystem/Subsystems/cmdUtil
       make
       cd ../..
       python3 GroundSystem.py

3. Select "Start Command System"
4. Select "Enable Tlm"
5. Enter IP address of system executing cFS, 127.0.0.1 if running locally

Should see telemetry, can send noops and see command counters increment

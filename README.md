# Core Flight System - BUNDLE

The Core Flight System (cFS) is a generic flight software architecture framework used on flagship spacecraft, human spacecraft, cubesats, and Raspberry Pi.  This repository is a bundle of submodules that make up the cFS framework.  Note the "lab" apps are intended as examples only, and enable this bundle to build, execute, receive commands, and send telemetry.  This is not a flight distribution, which is typically made up of the cFE, OSAL, PSP, and a selection of flight apps that correspond to specific mission requirements.

This bundle has not been fully verified as an operational system, and is provided as a starting point vs an end product.  Testing of this bundle consists of building, executing, sending setup commands and verifying receipt of telemetry.  Unit testing is also run, but extensive analysis is not performed.  All verification and validation per mission requirements is the responsibility of the mission (although attempts are made in the cFS Framework to provide a testing framework to facilitate the process).

The cFS Framework is a core subset of cFS.  There are additional OSALs, PSPs, and tools as listed below available from a variety of sources.

## Major future work

### Caelum (aka 7.0) Major release development plans (Targeting end of 2020 for release candidate)

  - Certification framework with automated build verification tests of framework requirements
    - Executable on real/emulated/simulated/ or dockerized targets
    - Add PSP coverage testing framework (nasa/psp#184, nasa/psp#174)
    - Add PSP and cFE functional testing framework for APIs  (nasa/cfe#779)
    - Scrub OSAL coverage and functional tests
    - Scrub cFE coverage tests
    - Add cFE API functional tests
    - NOTE: Command verification pending tool open source release
  - Documentation (updated traceability, APIs/ICDs, general update)
  - Framework for mission customization of core services
    - Header customization support (nasa/cFE#726)
  - Remove deprecated code
  - Cmd/Tlm structure scrub for alignment/padding/consistency
  - Library query and reporting and ES resource management (nasa/cFE#28, nasa/cFE#797)

### Other (may not make 7.0)
  - Open source automated build verification execution framework for emulated targets (likely docker based)
  - Deployment quality of life improvements (configuration, transition to CMake source selection vs compiler directives)
  - Update OS support (VxWorks 7, RTEMS 5)
  - Time services refactor
  - Symmetric multi-processing APIs
  - Electronic Data Sheet integration option and improvements to packet layouts for portability/consistency
  - Toolchain updates

## Getting Help

### Discussions 

You can [start a new discussion](https://github.com/nasa/cFS/discussions/new) for discussions, questions, or ideas, in the cFS repository under the Discussions tab.

### Join the mailing list

To **subscribe to our mailing list,** send an email to cfs-community-join@lists.nasa.gov with the word *subscribe* in the subject line.

The cfs-community mailing list includes cFS users and developers. The cFS Product Team also uses the mailing list to share information on current and future releases, bug findings and fixes, enhancement requests, community meetings, etc.

If you'd like to unsubscribe, send an email with the word *unsubscribe* to cfs-community-leave@lists.nasa.gov. Mailing list requests are typically processed within 5 minutes.

### Contact the cFS Product Team

You can email the cFS Product Team at cfs-program@lists.nasa.gov to explore partnerships and other arrangements for in-depth support.

## Setup

Ensure the following software are installed: Make, CMake, GCC, and Git.  To setup the cFS BUNDLE directly from the latest set of interoperable repositories:

    git clone https://github.com/nasa/cFS.git
    cd cFS
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

Copy in the default makefile and definitions:

    cp cfe/cmake/Makefile.sample Makefile
    cp -r cfe/cmake/sample_defs sample_defs

## Build and Run

The cFS Framework including sample applications will build and run on the pc-linux platform support package (should run on most Linux distributions), via the steps described in https://github.com/nasa/cFE/tree/master/cmake/README.md.  Quick-start is below:

To prep, compile, and run on the host (from cFS directory above) as a normal user (best effort message queue depth and task priorities):

    make SIMULATION=native prep
    make
    make install
    cd build/exe/cpu1/
    ./core-cpu1

Should see startup messages, and CFE_ES_Main entering OPERATIONAL state.  Note the code must be executed from the build/exe/cpu1 directory to find the startup script and shared objects.

Note: The steps above are for a debug, permissive mode build and includes deprecated elements.  For a release build, recommendation is `make BUILDTYPE=release OMIT_DEPRECATED=true prep`.  Unit tests can be added with `ENABLE_UNIT_TESTS=true`, run with `make test`, and coverage reported with `make lcov`.

## Send commands, receive telemetry

The cFS-GroundSystem tool can be used to send commands and receive telemetry.  For details on using and setting up the Ground System, see the [Guide-GroundSystem](https://github.com/nasa/cFS-GroundSystem/blob/main/Guide-GroundSystem.md).  Note it depends on PyQt5 and PyZMQ:

1. Install PyQt5 and PyZMQ on your system.  Some systems may also require installing libcanberra-gtk-module.

2. Compile cmdUtil and start the ground system executable

       cd tools/cFS-GroundSystem/Subsystems/cmdUtil
       make
       cd ../..
       python3 GroundSystem.py

3. Select "Start Command System"
4. Select "Enable Tlm"
5. Enter IP address of system executing cFS, 127.0.0.1 if running locally

Should see telemetry, can send noops and see command counters increment.

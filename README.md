# Core Flight System - BUNDLE

The Core Flight System (cFS) is a generic flight software architecture framework used on flagship spacecraft, human spacecraft, cubesats, and Raspberry Pi.  This repository is a bundle of submodules that make up the cFS framework.  Note the "lab" apps are intended as examples only, and enable this bundle to build, execute, receive commands, and send telemetry.  This is not a flight distribution, which is typically made up of the cFE, OSAL, PSP, and a selection of flight apps that correspond to specific mission requirements.

This bundle has not been fully verified as an operational system, and is provided as a starting point vs an end product.  Testing of this bundle consists of building, executing, sending setup commands and verifying receipt of telemetry.  Unit testing is also run, but extensive analysis is not performed.  All verification and validation per mission requirements is the responsibility of the mission (although attempts are made in the cFS Framework to provide a testing framework to facilitate the process).

The cFS Framework is a core subset of cFS, with an extensive ecosystem of applications and tools available throughout the community.

## Distributions

This is the open-source version of cFS, released under an Apache 2.0 license. The open source cFS is limited to the framework and common apps, libraries, and tools, which includes and is limited to: cFE, OSAL, PSP, Command Ingest (Lab), Telemetry Output (Lab), Scheduler (Lab), Sample App, Sample Lib, Data Storage, File Manager, HouseKeeping, Health and Safety, Memory Dwell, CFDP File Transfer, CheckSum, Limit Checker, Memory Manager, Stored Command, cFS Ground System, elf2cfetbl, and tblCRCTool. Changes to the open repositories are limited to bug fixes and minor enhancements to those components.

A Government-use (Distro C) version of cFS with features for a full flight mission is available through a Software User Agreement. For more information about government version features or to explore partnerships, please [contact the cFS team](<mailto:cfs-program@lists.nasa.gov>).

## Contact

cFS/cFE is owned and maintained by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center's Flight Software Systems Branch.

The cFS team provides training, support, and subject matter expertise to cFS users across industry and the government. New features/developments can also be done by the cFS team which has significant experience in helping flight projects implement mission-ready flight SW using cFS for various classes of missions, including human-rated (class A) missions. A support agreement may be needed.

To connect with the cFS team, please send an email to [cfs-program@lists.nasa.gov](<mailto:cfs-program@lists.nasa.gov>).

More information is available on the [cFS Website](<https://cfs.gsfc.nasa.gov>).

## Open-Source Roadmap

The following is a list of features and updates planned for cFS (in no particular order). Have other ideas? Want to partner with us? Please let us know at [cfs-program@lists.nasa.gov](<mailto:cfs-program@lists.nasa.gov>).

- "Bundler" tool to create custom bundles from known capability developed across the community (essentially an interactive catalog of apps that have been verified against a particular version of cFS)
- VxWorks 7 support, including running applications as real-time processes (RTPs)
- RTEMS 6 support
- Automated build verification execution framework for emulated targets
- Time services refactor/simplication
- Symmetric multi-processing (SMP) APIs
- Electronic Data Sheet (EDS) integration option and improvements to packet layouts for portability/consistency

## Setup

Ensure the following software are installed: Make, CMake, GCC, and Git.  To setup the cFS BUNDLE directly from the latest set of interoperable repositories (with your working directory set to where you want to put cFS):

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nasa/cFS.git
    cd cFS
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
```

Copy in the default makefile and definitions:

```bash
    cp cfe/cmake/Makefile.sample Makefile
    cp -r cfe/cmake/sample_defs sample_defs
```

## Build and Run

The cFS Framework including sample applications will build and run on the pc-linux platform support package (should run on most Linux distributions), via the steps described in [the cFE cmake readme](<https://github.com/nasa/cFE/tree/master/cmake/README.md>).  Quick-start is below:

To prep, compile, and run on the host (from cFS directory above) as a normal user (best effort message queue depth and task priorities):

```bash
    make distclean
        (For a clean build on subsequent runs)
    make SIMULATION=native prep
    make
    make install
    cd build/exe/cpu1/
    ./core-cpu1
```

Should see startup messages, and CFE_ES_Main entering OPERATIONAL state.  Note the code must be executed from the build/exe/cpu1 directory to find the startup script and shared objects.

Note: The steps above are for a debug, permissive mode build and includes deprecated elements.  For a release build, recommendation is `make BUILDTYPE=release OMIT_DEPRECATED=true prep`.  Unit tests can be added with `ENABLE_UNIT_TESTS=true` during the prep step, run with `make test`, and coverage reported with `make lcov`. Functional tests can be run by including `ENABLE_UNIT_TESTS=true` during prep and including the cfe_testcase app in the runtime app configuration (.scr file).

### Send commands, receive telemetry

The cFS-GroundSystem tool can be used to send commands and receive telemetry.  For details on using and setting up the Ground System, see the [Guide-GroundSystem](https://github.com/nasa/cFS-GroundSystem/blob/main/Guide-GroundSystem.md).  Note it depends on PyQt5 and PyZMQ:

1. Install PyQt5 and PyZMQ on your system.  Some systems may also require installing libcanberra-gtk-module.

2. Compile cmdUtil and start the ground system executable

```bash
       cd tools/cFS-GroundSystem/Subsystems/cmdUtil
       make
       cd ../..
       python3 GroundSystem.py
```

3. Select "Start Command System" from main window
4. Select "Enable Tlm"
5. Enter IP address of system executing cFS, 127.0.0.1 if running locally
6. Select "Start Telemetry System" from main window

Should see telemetry, can send noops and see command counters increment.

### Adding Custom Apps

See the [cFE Application Developer's Guide](https://github.com/nasa/cFE/blob/main/docs/cFE%20Application%20Developers%20Guide.md) for information about creating new apps. It is encouraged to use sample_app or skeleton_app as a starting point. Once the application has been created, it must be added to targets.cmake to be compiled and to the .scr file to be dynamically loaded at runtime (in a dynamically loaded environment).
